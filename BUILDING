- copy BookCatalogue from GIT
- extract 'ABS 4.2.zip' into the parent directory of BookCatalogue (this is ActionBar Sherlock 4.2.0)
- add the ABS 4.2 project to your eclipse workspace
- set both project targets to Android 4.2
- reference ABS as a library project in BC
- clean and rebuild

Building release builds:
Do not forget to change stub values in `api.properties` to correct ones,
when build release builds (this file is not needed for `debug` builds)
