This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books. 
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode.

* Books can be sorted by Author or Title. 
* Books can be automatically added by typing in the ISBN or scanning the 
  barcode. It will search Google Books for details (and download a thumbnail).

  books separate from my normal fiction books.

  suggestion list
