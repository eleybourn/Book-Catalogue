An open source book cataloguing application (source on github). Books can be added by scanning/typing ISBNs, searching by author/title, or added manually.

This application is ad free but does require the internet permission for searching, and uses vibration for optional haptic feedback.

Important! Remember to backup and export your existing catalogue before you upgrade! Nothing should go wrong, but it's always good to be safe.

Features include:

* User-customized sorting by any combination of author name(s), title, series, published-date, read-date, and many other fields.
* Searches Amazon, Google Books, goodreads and LibraryThing for data
* Bookshelves (books can be on multiple shelves, think of them as keywords or categories to be associated with the book)
* Automatic retrieval of cover thumbnails, which can be replaced via download, gallery or camera
* Lending of books
* goodreads synchronization
* Export and Backup

Want a wishlist? Just create a bookshelf called 'Wishlist' and start adding books.

Please email us (below) if you have any problems or suggestions, or experience any issues after an upgrade. Also email us if you want to help improve the translation into your language.
