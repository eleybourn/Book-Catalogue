 * The old 'BookCatalogue' activity is now called 'BookCatalogueClassic.
 * 
 * This activity just forwards to the StartupActivity.
 * 
 * In retrospect, this should have been done in the first place, but since we now
 * have users with shortcuts that point to 'StartupActivity', it is too late to fix.
